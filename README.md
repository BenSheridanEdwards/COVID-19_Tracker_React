COVID-19 Tracker with React Hooks, Material UI &amp; Charts.js

Uses the COVID-19 API to fetch daily data on the reported number of cases of people who are currently infected, have recovered and those who have sadly died from the virus. 

By default, you'll see current world figures on a line graph, but by using a drop-down menu you can filter by country and see bar graphs showing up to date figures on those infected, recovered, and the deaths from COVID-19. 

**Tech Stack:** *JavaScript, React, Node, CSS, Material-UI, HTML, Jest, Enzyme, Webpack, Babel, Charts.js, CircleCI, Code Climate, Firebase*

You'll find the app [here](), use cmd/window + click to open in a new tab.
